## Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side development?


I think Solana uses TypeScript for client apps because itâ€™s easy and familiar for web developers like me.
It works in both browsers and Node.js, so it has wider support.
TypeScript also helps catch mistakes early with types and auto-complete.
Overall, it makes building Solana apps simpler and more reliable for someone coming from Web2.
